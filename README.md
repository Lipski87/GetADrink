**Get a drink**- A graduation project at the end of a Java back-end course at CodersLab- IT school. The project involved creating a back-end for a web application for searching cocktails, using an external API connected to a database.  Functionalities: sign-up and sign-in, search by name, by ingredient, random, alcohol libraries (descriptions), saving user's favourite cocktails.
I built the project in Maven according to the Spring framework, applying modules such as Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security. I put the application on Tomcat. For the persistance layer I used Hibernate.
For testing purposes I created a basic front-end based on JSP views, however the application can be easily modified into a fully REST application. For transferring data in JSON format I utilised Jackson library. Users data are stored locally in MySQL database. The Lombok library helped me to create an objects classes.
